# AVL Tree

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that was invented by Adelson-Velsky and Landis in 1962. It is named after its inventors, and the acronym "AVL" stands for "Adelson-Velsky and Landis".

The AVL tree maintains a height-balanced binary search tree, meaning that the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differs by at most 1. This ensures that the search, insertion, and deletion operations take logarithmic time in the worst case, which is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

## Basic operations
The basic operations that can be performed on an AVL tree include:

1. **Search**: The search operation searches for a given key in the AVL tree. It starts at the root node and compares the key with the key of the current node. If the key is smaller, the search continues in the left subtree, otherwise, it continues in the right subtree.
1. **Insertion**: The insertion operation adds a new node with a given key to the AVL tree. It starts at the root node and searches for the correct position to insert the new node. After inserting the node, it checks if the balance factor of each node along the insertion path is still in the range [-1,1]. If not, it performs a rotation operation to rebalance the tree.
1. **Deletion**: The deletion operation removes a node with a given key from the AVL tree. It first searches for the node to be deleted, then removes it and adjusts the balance factor of the nodes along the deletion path. If the balance factor of any node becomes outside the range [-1,1], it performs a rotation operation to rebalance the tree.
1. **Rotation**: The rotation operation is used to rebalance the tree after insertion or deletion. There are two types of rotations: left rotation and right rotation. A left rotation is performed on a node with a right-heavy balance factor, and a right rotation is performed on a node with a left-heavy balance factor. The rotation operation moves the subtree rooted at the unbalanced node to a new position while preserving the binary search tree property and the height-balancing property.

## Complex operations

In addition to the basic operations of search, insertion, deletion, and rotation, there are several complex operations that can be performed on an AVL tree. These operations are designed to optimize the performance of the tree and improve its efficiency. Some of the complex operations that can be performed on an AVL tree include:

1. **Traversal**: The traversal operation visits all the nodes of the AVL tree in a particular order, such as in-order, pre-order, or post-order. This operation is useful for performing various tasks, such as printing the nodes of the tree, computing the height or depth of the tree, or checking the validity of the tree.
1. **Find successor and predecessor**: The find successor and predecessor operations are used to find the node that comes immediately after or before a given node in the AVL tree, respectively. These operations are useful for implementing algorithms that require sorted data, such as searching for the kth smallest or largest element in the tree.
1. **Balance factor computation**: The balance factor computation operation computes the balance factor of a given node in the AVL tree, which is the difference between the heights of its left and right subtrees. This operation is useful for determining whether the tree is balanced or not and for performing rebalancing operations.
1. **Range search**: The range search operation finds all the nodes in the AVL tree that have keys in a given range. This operation is useful for implementing algorithms that require searching for elements within a specific range, such as interval search or range query.
1. **Join and split**: The join and split operations are used to combine or split two AVL trees, respectively. The join operation takes two disjoint AVL trees with keys less than or greater than a given value and creates a new AVL tree that contains all the nodes from both trees. The split operation takes an AVL tree and a key and splits the tree into two AVL trees, one containing all the nodes with keys less than the given key and the other containing all the nodes with keys greater than or equal to the given key. These operations are useful for implementing data structures that require dynamic updates, such as persistent data structures.

## Uses and applications

AVL trees are commonly used in a variety of applications where efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of data are required. Some of the most common uses and applications of AVL trees are:

1. **Databases**: AVL trees are often used in databases for indexing and searching data. They can be used to store and retrieve large amounts of data efficiently.
1. **Compiler optimization**: AVL trees are used in compiler optimization for storing and searching the symbol tables. The symbol tables contain information about the program's variables and their data types, and AVL trees provide efficient lookup and insertion operations for these tables.
1. **Computer graphics**: AVL trees are used in computer graphics for storing and searching 3D objects and their attributes. They are particularly useful for ray tracing, collision detection, and other geometric algorithms.
1. **Network routing**: AVL trees are used in network routing algorithms for maintaining a routing table that stores information about the network topology. They can be used to search for the shortest path between two nodes in a network efficiently.
1. **File systems**: AVL trees are used in file systems for indexing and searching files. They can be used to store and retrieve large numbers of files and directories efficiently.
1. **Text editors**: AVL trees are used in text editors for storing and searching the text buffer. They can be used to implement fast search and replace operations, syntax highlighting, and other text processing features.
