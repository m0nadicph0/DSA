# Trees

A tree data structure is a non-linear data structure that is used to represent hierarchical relationships between elements. It consists of a set of nodes connected by edges, where each node can have zero or more child nodes. The topmost node of the tree is called the root node, and the nodes with no children are called leaf nodes.

Trees are commonly used to represent data in computer science, such as file systems, organization charts, and syntax trees in programming languages. They are also used in algorithms like binary search trees, heap trees, and decision trees.

One of the key features of trees is that they can be traversed in various ways, such as pre-order, in-order, post-order, and level-order. These traversals help to access all the nodes in the tree and perform operations like searching, insertion, deletion, and sorting.

Overall, trees are a flexible and powerful data structure that can be used in a wide variety of applications.

## Variants

There are many different variants of tree data structures known in computer science. Some of the most common types of trees include:

1. `Binary tree`: A tree where each node has at most two children.
1. `Binary search tree`: A binary tree where the left subtree of each node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key, and the right subtree contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
1. `AVL tree`: A binary search tree that is self-balancing, meaning that the heights of the left and right subtrees of every node differ by at most one.
1. `Red-black tree`: Another self-balancing binary search tree where the nodes are colored either red or black, and certain rules are enforced to ensure that the tree is balanced.
1. `B-tree`: A tree where each node can have multiple children and keys, and is commonly used in databases and file systems.
1. `Trie`: A tree where each node represents a string or sequence, and the edges represent the characters in the string.
1. `Segment tree`: A tree used for range queries, where each node represents a range of values and stores some aggregate value for that range.
