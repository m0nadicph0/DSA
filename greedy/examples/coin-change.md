## Coin Change

The coin change problem is a classic example of a greedy algorithm problem. It involves finding the minimum number of coins required to make a given amount of change. The problem is usually stated as follows:

Given a set of coin denominations (e.g., {1, 5, 10, 25}), and a target amount of change (e.g., 67 cents), what is the minimum number of coins required to make that amount of change?

To solve the coin change problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. The general idea is to always select the largest possible coin denomination that is less than or equal to the remaining amount of change to be made, until the entire amount has been accounted for. This approach works because it always selects the most valuable coin available at each step, which minimizes the total number of coins required.

Here are some examples to illustrate the coin change problem:

```
Example 1:
Coin denominations: {1, 5, 10, 25}
Target amount: 67 cents
Solution: 2 quarters, 1 dime, 1 nickel, 2 pennies (total of 6 coins)
```

```
Example 2:
Coin denominations: {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100}
Target amount: 89 cents
Solution: 1 half-dollar, 1 quarter, 1 dime, 4 pennies (total of 7 coins)
```

```
Example 3:
Coin denominations: {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100}
Target amount: 72 cents
Solution: 1 half-dollar, 2 pennies (total of 3 coins)
```

```
Example 4:
Coin denominations: {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100}
Target amount: 100 cents
Solution: 1 dollar coin (total of 1 coin)
```

```
Example 5:
Coin denominations: {1, 10, 25, 50}
Target amount: 82 cents
Solution: 1 half-dollar, 1 nickel, 2 pennies (total of 4 coins)
```

These examples show that the greedy algorithm for the coin change problem can produce optimal 
solutions in many cases. However, there are some scenarios where the greedy algorithm does not 
always produce the optimal solution, such as when the coin denominations are not a multiple of 
each other (e.g., {1, 7, 10}), or when there are limited numbers of certain coin denominations 
available. In those cases, a more sophisticated algorithm, such as dynamic programming, may be 
required to find the optimal solution.

```go
// Define a problem and a set of candidate solutions.
// For the coin change problem, we are given a set of coin denominations
// and a target amount of change to make. The candidate solution is the
// set of coins used to make the change.
type CoinChangeProblem struct {
    denominations []int
    targetAmount  int
}

// Identify a criterion for evaluating the candidate solutions.
// For the coin change problem, the criterion is the total number of coins used.
func (p *CoinChangeProblem) evaluateSolution(coinsUsed []int) int {
    count := 0
    for _, c := range coinsUsed {
        count += c
    }
    return count
}

// Define a rule for selecting the best candidate solution.
// For the coin change problem, the rule is to always select the largest
// possible coin denomination that is less than or equal to the remaining
// amount of change to be made.
func (p *CoinChangeProblem) selectCandidate(coinsUsed []int, remainingAmount int) (int, int) {
    for i := len(p.denominations) - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
        if p.denominations[i] <= remainingAmount {
            return i, p.denominations[i]
        }
    }
    return -1, -1
}

// Repeat the selection rule until a satisfactory solution is found.
func (p *CoinChangeProblem) solve() []int {
    coinsUsed := make([]int, len(p.denominations))
    remainingAmount := p.targetAmount
    for remainingAmount > 0 {
        index, coin := p.selectCandidate(coinsUsed, remainingAmount)
        if index == -1 {
            break
        }
        coinsUsed[index]++
        remainingAmount -= coin
    }
    return coinsUsed
}
```
To use this implementation to solve a specific instance of the coin change problem, 
we would create a CoinChangeProblem instance with the desired coin denominations and 
target amount, and then call the solve method to obtain the solution as an array of coin counts:

```go
// Solve the coin change problem for the denominations {1, 5, 10, 25} and target amount 67.
problem := &CoinChangeProblem{denominations: []int{1, 5, 10, 25}, targetAmount: 67}
coinsUsed := problem.solve()
fmt.Printf("Coins used: %v\n", coinsUsed) // Output: Coins used: [2 1 1 2]

```
This output indicates that the optimal solution for making 67 cents using the 
denominations {1, 5, 10, 25} is to use 2 quarters, 1 dime, 1 nickel, and 2 pennies.
