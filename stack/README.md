# Stack

## Basic operations

The basic operations of a stack are:

* `Push`: This operation adds an element to the top of the stack.
* `Pop`: This operation removes the top element from the stack.
* `Peek` or `Top`: This operation returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
* `isEmpty`: This operation checks if the stack is empty.
* `isFull`: This operation checks if the stack is full.
