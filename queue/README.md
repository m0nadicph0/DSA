# Queue

A queue is a linear data structure in which elements are added to one end, known as the "rear" or "tail" of the queue, and removed from the other end, known as the "front" or "head" of the queue. The basic operations supported by a queue data structure are:

1. `Enqueue`: Adding an element to the rear of the queue. This operation is also known as "push".
1. `Dequeue`: Removing an element from the front of the queue. This operation is also known as "pop".
1. `Front`: Returning the front element of the queue without removing it.
1. `Rear`: Returning the rear element of the queue without removing it.
1. `Size`: Returning the number of elements currently in the queue.
1. `Empty`: Returning whether the queue is empty or not.
